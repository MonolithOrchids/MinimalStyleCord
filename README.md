### Minimalist Theme for Discord
For now, this theme is very simplistic, it doesnâ€™t change much, just the size of some bars, remove some useless stuff and that's it. It was mainly made for some friends and personal use, down the road I will try to add features included on my old theme, [MinimalNight](https://github.com/MonolithOrchids/MinimalNightTheme/tree/master).

### [**Vencord**](https://vencord.dev) or [**Vesktop**](https://github.com/Vencord/Vesktop):  
- ***Method 1***: 
	- Download [**MinimalNight.theme.css**](https://github.com/MonolithOrchids/MinimalStyleCord/blob/master/MinimalStyleCord.theme.css) and navigate to **Settings > Themes** and click **Open Themes Folder** or place the file in **%appdata%/Vencord/themes** and then enable **MinimalStyleCord**.    
- ***Method 2***: 
	- Navigate to **Settings > Themes** and go to **Online Themes** tab and in the input field paste in this URL:  
```https://github.com/MonolithOrchids/MinimalStyleCord/blob/master/MinimalStyleCord.theme.css```

## Recommended
Change **UI Density** at Appearance Settings to Compact.

Also, as optional, you can also change some of the sizes like it's showed below:

# Customizing the theme

MinimalNight has certain unique variables that can easily be modified to change the visibility and width of certain elements. The code can either be added to the **MinimalStyleCord.theme.css** or the **Custom CSS** menu in Discord settings:

```css
:root {
    --Reaction-Forward-Message-Hover: flex;		/* flex = ON, none = OFF */
}
```
